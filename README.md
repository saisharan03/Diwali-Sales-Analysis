This project involves conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing Diwali sales information. The goal is to uncover insights into purchasing behaviors, demographic trends, and product performance during the festive season. Below is a detailed description of the analysis:

---

 Project Objective
To analyze Diwali sales data to identify:
- Key demographic groups contributing to sales.
- Product categories and items that are top-sellers.
- Regional trends and their impact on sales performance.
- Insights into customer behaviors such as spending patterns by gender, age, and occupation.

 Process Overview

# 1. Data Loading and Preparation
- Imported necessary Python libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data manipulation and visualization.
- Loaded the dataset using `pd.read_csv()` with proper encoding to handle non-ASCII characters.
- Performed initial exploration using `.shape`, `.info()`, and `.head()` to understand the dataset structure and contents.
- Cleaned the dataset by:
  - Dropping unrelated/empty columns (`Status`, `unnamed1`).
  - Handling missing values in the `Amount` column.
  - Converting data types (e.g., `Amount` to integer).

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Demographic Analysis
- Gender:
  - Bar charts showed that females were the majority of buyers and had higher purchasing power than males.
- Age Group:
  - Most buyers were in the 26–35 age group, with females leading in purchasing power.

## Regional Trends
- State-wise Analysis:
  - Identified top-performing states for orders and sales, with Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka topping the list.
- Zone-wise Insights:
  - Analyzed the contribution of different zones (e.g., Northern, Southern) to sales and orders.

## Marital Status
- Majority of buyers were married, and married women exhibited higher purchasing power.

## Occupational Insights
- Top professions contributing to sales were IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, indicating higher disposable income in these groups.

## Product Performance
- Product Categories:
  - Food, Clothing, and Electronics emerged as the most sold categories.
- Top Products:
  - Highlighted the top-selling products and their order trends using group-by operations and visualizations.

 Visualization Techniques
- Used `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to create bar plots, count plots, and line charts for trend analysis.
- Customized visualizations with clear labels, legends, and tooltips to enhance interpretability.
- Applied sorting to highlight top contributors across categories like states, age groups, and products.
